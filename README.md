# What is this?
Republic is a quick card game I made for a computer science homework task; it's in the form of a
typescript + next.js app, and it can be played by downloading the code and running it on your
machine with `npm run dev`.

Alternatively, a hosted version is available at [https://republic.crawling.us](https://republic.crawling.us).
